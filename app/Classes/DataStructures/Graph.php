/**
 * Graph
 * 
 * A graph is a mathematical construct used to model the relationships between 
 * key/value pairs. A graph comprises a set of vertices (nodes) and an arbitrary
 * number of edges (lines) which connect them. These edges can be directed or 
 * undirected. A directed edge is simply an edge between two vertices, and edge
 * A->B is not considered the same as B->A. An undirected edge has no 
 * orientation or direction; edge A-B is equivalent to B-A. 
 * 
 * A tree structure which we learned about last time can be considered a type of
 * undirected graph, where each vertex is connected to at least one other vertex
 * by a simple path.
 * 
 * Graphs can also be weighted or unweighted. A weighted graph, or a network, is
 * one in which a weight or cost value is assigned to each of its edges. 
 * Weighted graphs are commonly used in determining the most optimal path, most
 * expedient, or the lowest "cost" path between two points. GoogleMapâ€™s driving 
 * directions is an example that uses weighted graphs.
